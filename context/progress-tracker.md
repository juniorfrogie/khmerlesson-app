# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation change. If bugs or any suggestion found, add it to Next Up.

## Current Phase

- In progress

## Current Goal

- Build core feature components and screens

## Completed

- Design system foundation: `src/shared/theme/index.ts` — Colors, Spacing, Radius, FontSize, FontWeight, Shadow tokens
- Shared UI components: Text, Button, Badge, ProgressBar (`src/shared/components/`)
- Course feature: `Course` type, `CourseCard` component (`src/features/courses/`)
- Lesson feature: `Lesson`, `LessonDetail`, `VocabItem` types, `LessonRow` component (`src/features/lessons/`)
- Mock data: courses and lessons with Khmer script (`context/mock-data/`)
- Home screen: greetings header, "Continue Learning", all courses list
- Explore screen: course browsing with level filter chips (All / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
- Course detail screen (`app/course/[id].tsx`): hero header, progress bar, lesson list
- Lesson detail screen (`app/lesson/[id].tsx`): vocabulary cards, "Mark as Complete" action
- Tab bar updated: Home + Explore tabs using Ionicons
- Root layout: consistent header styling, dark status bar
- Onboarding screen (`app/onboarding.tsx`): 3-slide horizontal pager with icon, English + Khmer title, body copy; Skip / Next / Get Started actions
- First-launch gate in `app/index.tsx`: hydrates auth, checks onboarding flag, routes to onboarding / login / tabs accordingly
- Auth types (`src/features/auth/types.ts`): `User`, `AuthTokens`, `AuthState`, `AuthProvider`
- Zustand auth store (`src/features/auth/store/authStore.ts`): `setAuth`, `setGuest`, `signOut`, `hydrate` — persists to AsyncStorage
- Login screen (`app/auth/login.tsx`): Google + Apple buttons, "Continue as Guest" → tabs; `isGuest` state in store
- Onboarding "Get Started" / Skip now routes to `/auth/login` instead of tabs
- Apple Sign-In (`src/features/auth/service.ts` `signInWithApple`): calls `expo-apple-authentication`, exchanges identity token with `POST /api/auth/verify-apple-id-token`, stores user + tokens via auth store; cancel is silently ignored, other errors shown inline
- `apiPost<T>` and `apiPostForm<T>` added to `src/services/api.ts`; form-encoded variant used by Apple + Google + other auth endpoints
- Google Sign-In (`signInWithGoogle` in service.ts): `expo-auth-session` PKCE flow → Google userinfo API → `POST /api/auth/register-auth-service` (form-encoded, `registrationType: "google"`) → store; cancel/dismiss is silent, errors shown inline
- Me tab (`app/(tabs)/me.tsx`): replaces Explore tab; auth-guarded (unauthenticated → `/auth/login`); shows avatar initials, name, email, provider badge; Support (mailto), Privacy Policy (url), Log Out (alert confirm → signOut), Delete Account (alert confirm → TODO API)
- Tab layout: Explore hidden (`href: null`), Me tab added with person icon
- Purchase course flow (`app/course/purchase.tsx`, `src/features/courses/service/purchaseService.ts`): IAP via `react-native-iap` (deferred require for Expo Go safety); connects IAP, loads product price, handles new purchase + existing entitlement resume, records to `POST /api/v1/purchase-history`, finishes transaction; auto-refreshes expired access token during purchase
- Lesson progress store (`src/features/lessons/store/progressStore.ts`): Zustand store persisted to AsyncStorage; tracks completed lessons per course and last-accessed lesson; hydrated on app startup alongside auth store
- Completed lesson UI: `LessonRow` shows green checkmark icon when lesson is complete
- Continue Learning section on home screen: appears after first lesson visit; tapping resumes the last-accessed lesson directly
- Lesson tracking wired end-to-end: `lesson/[id].tsx` calls `setLastAccessed` on load and `markComplete` on Finish; `course/[id].tsx` passes courseId/courseTitle params and shows completed state per row
- Onboarding prefetch: `prefetchCourses()` called on onboarding mount; home screen renders instantly from module-level cache with no loading spinner; animated toast banner shows success / no-internet / server-unavailable as appropriate
- TTS: replaced `expo-speech` with backend proxy (`GET /api/tts?q=<text>`) played via `expo-av`; Khmer language hardcoded server-side; new service at `src/features/lessons/service/ttsService.ts`

## In Progress

## Next Up

- SQLite offline caching (via `src/database/`) — free lessons only; see Open Questions for premium complexity
- Load course data once (cache in Zustand so navigating back to the course tab doesn't re-fetch)
- Add pull to refresh on course page

## Open Questions

- **Offline premium content complexity**: Caching free lessons offline is straightforward (SQLite). Premium offline is harder and needs decisions before SQLite work starts:
  1. Purchase entitlement must be stored locally (separate SQLite table) so offline access works — `purchaseService.ts` currently writes nothing to local storage after a purchase.
  2. The 1-year revalidation rule (architecture.md) is undefined in implementation: when does the app check? (app open, background, only when online?) What happens if the user is offline past 1 year?
  3. No content-invalidation strategy if premium lesson content is updated after caching.
  - **Recommendation**: Start with API-only premium access (no offline for premium) and add offline premium as a separate phase once the free-lesson sync is proven. This avoids coupling purchase entitlement to the SQLite layer prematurely.

## Architecture Decisions

- Theme tokens live in `src/shared/theme/` (not `constants/`) to align with the `src/` folder structure defined in architecture.md
- Old `constants/theme.ts` and boilerplate components kept untouched; new screens use the new design system only
- Mock data lives in `context/mock-data/` until API/SQLite layer is ready

## Session Notes

- All new screens are under `app/course/[id].tsx` and `app/lesson/[id].tsx`
- `@/src/...` imports work via the existing `@/*` path alias in tsconfig.json
